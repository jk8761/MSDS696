This project will accomplish Image recognition on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, available from ref(1). The dataset is separated into a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
